Password Generator

This repository contains a password generator that returns random characters, such as lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. 

I have setup user prompts to allow the user to choose what character types they would like to include in their password between 8 and 128 characters. In the event these terms are not met, the user will be met with an alert specifying them to meet the terms of the conditions.
